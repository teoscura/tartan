    <h1 font-size=15>Tartan</h1>
    <p>A C++23 Reimplementation of the Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 Server</p>
</div>

I genuinely have no idea where this project will end up, _if it ends anywhere to be honest_
The goal of this project is to learn as much stuff as i possibly can, overkill is welcome.

TODO = write a todo-list:

So far it just gets us across the login procedure, or at least, used to.

Dependencies:
+ C++23 
+ That's it.

### How to Run - linux ###
```
    git clone https://github.com/teoscura/tartan
    cd tartan
    make
    target/main
```

Thats it so far.
