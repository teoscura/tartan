# Tartan #
## A Multithreaded C++23 implementation of a server for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 ##

I genuinely have no idea where this project will end up, _if it ends anywhere to be honest_

TODO = write a todo-list:

So far it just gets us across the login procedure, or at least, used to.

Dependencies:
+ Sqlite3 
+ That's it.

### How to Run ###
```
    git clone https://github.com/teoscura/tartan
    cd tartan
    make
    target/main
```

Thats it so far.
